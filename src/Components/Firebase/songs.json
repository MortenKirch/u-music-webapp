    "lyrics": "Concorde flies in my room\nTears the house to shreds\nDefines the night as such:\nA home for us, stick insects\nAnd leaves no trace of luck\nAt every market town that we intersect\nI die like fifteen times\nA dark blue stem brings me to their breast\nAnd I'm feeling kinda normal with a packed lunch\nTrain rides don't hurt much these days\nWe're all working on ourselves\nAnd we're praying that the rest don't mind how much we've changed\nSo if you see me looking strange with a fresh style\nI'm still not feeling that great\nAnd then it's in soft focus all around you\nYou can't see the football game\nOn my dad's sofa we are still\nAnd we never look at our phones anymore\nOh, I can't think of anything better\nPick a hair off my sweater\nAnd drown in me\nLike boyfriend jeans\nOh, I haven't felt this way in like ever\nI am the convo, you are the weather\nAnd the clamp is a cracked smile cheek\nAnd it tortures me\nI haven't felt this way in like ever\nI am the convo, you are the weather\nAnd the clamp is a cracked smile cheek\nAnd it tortures me\nIn my bed sheets now wet\nOf Charlie I pray to forget\nAll I've been forms the drone\nWe sing the rest\nAh, your generous loan to me\nYour crippling interest\nIn my bed sheets now wet\nOf Charlie I pray to forget\nAll I've been forms the drone\nWe sing the rest\nAh, your generous loan to me\nYour crippling interest\nIn my bed sheets now wet\nOf Charlie I pray to forget\nAll I've been forms the drone\nWe sing the rest\nAh, your generous loan to me\nYour crippling interest",
