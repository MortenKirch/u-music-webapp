Am I home?\nI will hold to my chest where the wind can't exist\nI will try not to keep you too long\nSo clean your soup maker and breathe in\nYour chicken broccoli and everything\nThe tug that's between us that long string\nConcorde, Bound 2 and my evening\nThe good hunter's guide to a bad night\nDarling, I'll spoil it myself, thanks you're leaving\nWell, I tried just to stroke your dreams better\nBut darling, I see that you're not really sleeping\nBut I know\nYou're tired\nWell, I'm tired too\nOh but every time I try to make lunch\nFor anyone else in my head\nI end up dreaming of you\nAnd you come to me\nGood morning\nShow me the place where he inserted the blade\nOr praise the Lord, burn my house\nI get lost, I freak out\nYou come home and hold me tight\nAs if it never happened at all\nGood morning\nShow me the fifth or the cadence you want me to play\nGood morning\nShow me where to tie the other end of this chain",

      "extendedDescription": "Hip hop is a form of music emphasizing rhythmic beat patterns and spoken delivery rather than harmonic melodies and sung vocals. Much of hip hop's roots can be traced to Deejay, a form of Reggae music that immigrant DJ Kool Herc hoped to emulate in the Bronx borough of New York City. The style quickly took over in more populated areas like Harlem and Queens, where many enjoyed the loose, Afrocentric nature of the parties Herc would put on. Adapting the format to Disco and Funk breaks rather than the reggae Herc utilized further enhanced the genre's appeal in urban communities.",
