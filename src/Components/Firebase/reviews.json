    "reviewtext": "This album can only be described as perfect. The mixing, instrumentation, and vocal performances are astounding. Every time I come back to this masterpiece I always pick up on something new. The approach that Kendrick takes on struggles of the BLM movement and living in the US as a person of color is well depicted and has changed the way I think about the issues. I could revisit every track on this album individually, the standouts for me are: The opener 'Wesley's Theory' George Clinton and Thundercat add greatly to the psychedelic funk feel of the opener with the ending flows greatly into 'For Free','King Kunta' has a more simple feeling but still does a great job in its instrumentation and vocals, 'Alright' is my personal favorite single from the album I love how Kendrick raps over Pharrell's beat especially the bridge of the song with a great transition into the second interlude of the album. This album deserves all the praise it gets; you can really tell Kendrick worked hard to perfect this album as every song is a 10/10.",

    "reviewtext": "Madvillainy is a truly relevatory album. Really a unique work with its short tracks and innovative production. Madlib is a freaking awesome producer, going above and beyond what's normally expected from the men behind the boards. MF DOOM also has a hayday. His wordplay is exceptional. That, combined with his deadpan delivery and great flow, makes a match for the ridiculous beats he'd been supplied with. The seminal hip hop release of the decade as far as I know.",
